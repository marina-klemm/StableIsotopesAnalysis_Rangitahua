# Stable Isotopes Analysis Rangitāhua

These are the scripts used to correct, standardize and analyze the stable isotopes data of 408 marine and terrestrial samples from Rangitāhua, spanning 169 years of collections (1854 - 2023).
The research collaborators recognize Ngāti Kuri as the mana whenua and mana moana of Rangitāhua. The research is conducted under Ngāti Kuri leadership through Te Ara Whānui Research Centre, with support and guidance from Puu Kaiao – a Living Protocol that governs Te Mana o Rangitāhua and operates between Ngāti Kuri and Tāmaki Paenga Hira Auckland Museum.
